> A web application framework using the Reactive Model-View-Intent architecture and Virtual
DOM Rendering.

* **Unidirectional Dataflow**: based on the Model-View-Intent architecture, data moves
  from Model to View, events move from View to Intent, and Intent sends "user intentions"
  to the Model. They are tied together as a cycle.
* **Purely Reactive**: all components are event-driven and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)
  is a hard dependency, which simplifies all code related to events, asynchronicity, and
  errors.
* **Virtual DOM Rendering**: Views re-render completely whenever Models emit any event.
  The use of [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) keeps performance
  optimal by patching the actual DOM with only the minimum necessary changes.
* **MVI is functional**: each node in the MVI cycle behaves like a function,
  receiving events as input, and outputting events. No side effects. This makes it
  convenient for composing with other components, or for automating tests.

## Example

```javascript
var Cycle = require('cyclejs');
var h = Cycle.h;

var HelloModel = Cycle.createModel(function (intent) {
  return {name$: intent.get('changeName$').startWith('')};
});

var HelloView = Cycle.createView(function (model) {
  return {
    vtree$: model.get('name$')
      .map((name) =>
        h('div', {}, [
          h('label', 'Name:'),
          h('input', {
            attributes: {'type': 'text'},
            oninput: 'inputText$'
          }),
          h('h1', 'Hello ' + name)
        ])
      )
  };
});

var HelloIntent = Cycle.createIntent(function (view) {
  return {
    changeName$: view.get('inputText$').map((ev) => ev.target.value)
  };
});

Cycle.createRenderer('.js-container').inject(HelloView);
HelloIntent.inject(HelloView).inject(HelloModel).inject(HelloIntent);
```

Notice that each of the 3 components has a neighbour component as input, and each outputs
an object mostly containing Rx Observables. At the bottom, the Renderer we created
subscribes to changes of `HelloView.vtree$` and renders those virtual elements into
`.js-container` in the DOM. `inject()` just ties all three Model, View, and
Intent together by telling them that they depend on each other circularly.

## Learn more

Model-View-Intent is similar to Flux, and Virtual DOM Rendering is inspired by React,
however there are several differences worth paying attention. Read the [seminal blog post
that lead to the creation of Cycle.js](http://futurice.com/blog/reactive-mvc-and-the-virtual-dom).

It has [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS)
as hard dependencies. Cycle.js is a "glue" framework providing helpers for building the
Model-View-Intent architecture properly with those technologies. Cycle.js's code itself is
still under 400 lines of code only.

## Why?

Why would you use Cycle.js instead of other web frameworks such as Angular and React? Here
are a couple of strong reasons:

- **Separation of concerns.** The reactive pattern for Models, Views, and Intents makes it
  possible for no component to have functions such as `updateSomething()` which inherently
  create coupling. You can write code with single responsibilities throughout. For
  instance, the View just takes model data and renders virtual elements, it doesn't even
  have callbacks to handle events.
- **Superb testability.** Everything is a JavaScript function or a [DataFlowNode](https://github.com/staltz/cycle/blob/master/docs/data-flow-nodes.md),
  so testing is mostly a matter of feeding input and inspecting the output. You can even
  test styles if you use functions to output your styles instead of using CSS files.
- **Rendering separated from View.** Contrary to what you expect, a View in Cycle.js does
  not directly render anything to the browser. Instead, it just outputs virtual DOM
  elements. This allows for better testability, and also makes it easier to implement
  UI skins since it is just a matter of introducing Skin components taking Views as input
  and doing some post-processing before the actual rendering.
- **Welcomes immutable and stateless programming.** Cycle.js is built for, in
  combination with RxJS, a programming style that favors immutability and statelessness.
  This allows code to be clearer and less prone to bugs.

## Disclaimer

### Work in progress

Cycle.js is in alpha mode, many changes to the API will likely occur before v1.0 is released.
Use this framework only for experiments before that. PS: we don't want to stay as alpha
forever, either. ;)

Prior to v1.0.0, the versions will follow the convention: improvements that break backwards
compatibility increment the minor number, any other improvements will increment the patch
number. After v1.0.0, we will follow [http://semver.org/](semver).
